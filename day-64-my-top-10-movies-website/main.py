# Probably my last day with this course, before I decide some day to continue again
# Exams are right on the doorstep and I don't think I can get much further in the days
# to come, so after today's project, python will be halted for me.

# In this one, we're making a TOp 10 movie display website, one tha tactually has some
# styling, rather than just looking like the 90s, like the day 63 sql learning project was
# The basic Flask app structure, websites structure and styles have been given
# Now we just need to make it functional
# The inspiration is probably from the tons of website that have made similar lists, and
# a website that is just about people making lists: https://www.listchallenges.com/

# After running the app, I saw that a lot more had been done than I would have expected
# The look of the website was set in stone, we just needed to work with the data entry
# and storage stuff. Basically just a database project.
