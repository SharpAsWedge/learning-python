<!--Today's topic is Bootstrap: An external CSS Framework
Frameworks for CSS are css that professionals have prewritten for us and we can just use
them directly by using the classes from these files. Bootstrap is the most popular among
the CSS Frameworks, and allows for quick implementation of responsive and beautiful CSS
It can cause something called "class bloat" where we are specifying the styles of our
page within the HTML in the form of classes, while it should have been otherwise handled
in the CSS file, leaving HTML the structural aspect only-->
