# Today there's only one thing, and that one thing is a Herculean project compared
# to whatever has been done so far. Let's work on a blackjack game today
# In order to maintain simplicity, not everything will be implemented here
# It is a one day project so these are the rules we will implement acc to the course
# 1. Infinite size deck, so list of cards will remain static no matter how many draw
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# 2. J,K,Q are all worth 10 and A is 11 or 1 depending on if the total is > or <= 21
# 3. The rule of the game is to get the highest total points, without exceeding 21
# 4. The computer is the dealer and only one of their first 2 cards is known
# 5. We either draw (hit) another card or stop/halt (stand)
#  After stopping the computer makes its choices and winner is then decided
# With all this in mind, and disregarding rules like double bet, split and so on...
# Let's start with the project, there were 4 difficulty levels but obv I'm taking expert

import random
from os import system
# I had defined the cards list here, but it wasn't used anywhere apart from dealing function
# So I just cut-pasted it into that function for better readability like the course
# The logo file was from the course as usual:
