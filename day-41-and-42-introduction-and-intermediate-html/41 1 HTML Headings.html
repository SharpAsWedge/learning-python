<!--In today's lessons, we will be switching from python to HTML
and learning about it from the basics.
Internet is just a connection of different computers in the world,
some computers are servers, that have data to provide, and some are
clients, which request for the data from the servers.
To show a website's contents, we type a website's address
and our browser sends it to our ISP which sends it to a DNS server
which looks up the IP (unique identification of the server computer)
and gives the information back to us. Then we request the data from
the ip address which usually contains a HTML, CSS and/or JS data
The server might not be same for any two instances or locations since
some services either use Dynamic IP or use Content Delivery Networks(CDNs)
to provide the server that is closest to the client.
A website can work, and did work without CSS and JS, but without HTML
the structure and content of the website can't be established so we
need to first learn HTML.
We can use https://nslookup.io to see the IP address of websites
We can use https://submarinecablemap.com to see underground cables that
form the backbone of the internet-->

<!--The first thing we'll learn in HTML is Headings.
Headings are HTML elements
HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is a file in which text can point to
some other part of a page or some other page, and tags can be used to
mark up the text in the page.
HTML Elements are made up of Tags and Content. There are two types
of tags: opening and closing tags, which are enclosed with angular brackets
and the ending tag contains a forward slash before the tag text
The content is wrapped between the opening and closing tags-->

<!--Our first task today is to make use of headings, which range in
different flavors: from H1 to H6, to make the text look like what was given
in the goal.png file. I have omitted all files but this file will look the
same so this should give you enough of an idea-->

<h1>Book</h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3>Section 1</h3>
    <h3>Section 2</h3>
  <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <h3>Section 1</h3>
      <h4>Diagram 1</h4>
  <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <h3>Section 1</h3>
    <h3>Section 2</h3>
  
<!--This file was originally called index.html but I thought maybe I'll have
a separate file for all lectures, as the starting files were separated as well
I'll just give them a number for chronological ordering instead.

Also, if I didn't have Prettier, the code would auto format on saving by removing
all indentations. So I'm glad I have it on since the start. I had to download the
following VSCode Extensions for this day's lesson:
Live Preview, vscode-icons (Though I'm not very satisfied with the config for latter)-->

<!--Do's and Don'ts about the heading element: (By convention)
1. Don't have more than one H1 in a single page
2. Don't skip a heading level and jump from H1 to H3 or H4, go serially down
