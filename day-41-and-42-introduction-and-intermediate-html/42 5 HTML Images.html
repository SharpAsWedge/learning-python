<!--For this task, we'll be using the image element in HTML to display
an image in the HTML document in the browser.
The <img /> element is a void element i.e. it has a self-closing tag
It also has an imperative attribute called "src" or source where we can
specify the source of the image, else what is the point of image element
Another attribute is the "alt" which specified alternative text for the
image, which is important for making our website accessible to those with
vision impairment, and using a screen reader to read out the screen-->

<!--The task was to make a page with a heading and use an image among
the ones given which either says cat person or a dog person
Since I'm a cat person I'll be using that-->

<h1>I'm a cat person</h1>

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appbrewery/webdev/main/kitten.jpeg" alt="Cat on a palm" />

<!--Alt text isn't ALWAYS mandatory, but for most cases it's better to have them there-->
