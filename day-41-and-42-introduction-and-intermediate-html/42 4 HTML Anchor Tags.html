<h1>My top 5 Favourite Websites</h1>

<!--In this task, well be using the HTML anchor tag to make a list of our
top 5 favorite websites. We will be including them inside a list element each
An anchor tag is represented by <a> but it's not sufficient since it is something
that allows us to create hyperlinks, and for that we need to set a target.
So we need to add an attribute for the anchor tag
An HTML attribute provides additional information about an element.
Some attributes are tag specific, and some are global, and global tags can be used
with any elements. An example is "draggable" which can be set to true or false-->

<!--Another task was to look at the devdocs and figure out a way to make the list start from 5
instead of starting from 1
Since I'm running out of time and have a bit of an idea about what to do I'll just directly do it-->

<ol start= "5">

<!--In code, we need to include text inside double quotes, like we have done with the links here
This is to differentiate them from the HTML tags and other reserved words-->
