<!--For this task, we have to use the list elements in HTML-->
<!--Let's not worry about the boilerplate for now, I'll work with it later but basically
There are two types of list elements in HTML: Unordered Lists and Ordered Lists
Unordered Lists (<ul>): These are for lists that don't have a definite order
Ordered Lists (<ol>): These are for lists that have a definite order
Inside the list element, the list items must be enclosed within <li> tag

The task had a predefined look and this HTML file will achieve that look.-->

<!--Some elements are in single lines, but others may be spread out to multiple lines
It boils down to personal preference which one we prefer, whether we want all items to have a
similar sandwich type look, or in my case, I prefer the list items and single line stuff to be
in a single line-->
