<!--In this task, we're not given a starting code, but we need to make
our code look like the one in the course. When we render this file in the browser,
the result will be shown, which will match the course example.
The task was to nest list within a list item of another list, and then in the file
the "code" should be indented so as to be understandable about what is going on-->

<!--A nice thing about VSCode is that it auto indents our elements
So that we don't have to worry that we'll mess it up
In adddition, it makes debugging easier since usually, the opening
and closing tags should be at the same indentation level and if 
they aren't then it may mean something is off.-->
