<!--The HTML Boilerplate is a starting HTML document that defines the strucure that
a HTML document should follow. We can use our own boilerplate or we can just use the
one VSCode offers by using ! and then pressing enter on a new .html file. Let me do that-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--This line defines that we will be using the HTML5 version, which was introduced in 2012-->
<html lang="en">
<!--This is the root of the document, all the html elements will be enclosed between the start
and the ending html tag. We use indentation to specify the depth of each element, and make it
easier to see what is nested inside what. It makes no difference to the HTML rendering in the
browser no matter whether we indent or not.
In this tag, 'lang' is an attribute to the tag html which is given the value 'en' which means
the content in this website is English. It is mostly for accessibility purposes for example for
screen readers for blind people, they will read out the content in the language specified.-->
    <head>
    <!--This section contains the data that is not visible to the users but still is used to
    setup how the content will be presented in the browser-->
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <!--The charset is a list of characters, and UTF-8 is the most popular charset which
        supports a variety of characers including numbers, symbols, emojis.
        We might use different charsets as per requirements, but usually UTF-8 is the best bet.-->
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <!--In the course, there was also a meta tag that defined the content to be for Internet
        Explorer, but seems like VSCode has removed it in later versions, since IE is deprecated now
        This tag gets the device dimensions and serves the content in a suitable format for it-->
        <title>My Website</title>
        <!--This contains the text that is displayed on the top of the website as its name/title-->
    </head>
    <body>
    <!--This is where all the contents visible to the user resides. All we learnt in Day 41 is for this-->
        <h1>Hi, this is Boilerplate</h1>
        <p>
            What am I doing <br>
            The whole crowd is booing <br>
            I can't escape the noise <br>
            It's drowning out my voice. 
        </p>
        <p>Welp, there goes an impromptu poem for this page.</p>
