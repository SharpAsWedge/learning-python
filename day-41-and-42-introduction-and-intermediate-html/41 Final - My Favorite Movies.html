<h2>These are 3 movies off the top of my head</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Man From Earth</h3>
<p>Offers a thought provoking insight on human civilization and our faiths as a whole</p>

<h3>Kimi no na wa</h3>
<p>Beautiful piece of animated art that has many subtle heart touching moments</p>

<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>One of the first psychological thrillers I watched, and I don't want to watch more either</p>
