# In today's lesson we're first working with Pycharm. Though I'm using VSCode
# I will be using Pycharm and them copying it off of there to end it.
# In fact, I'm writing this in Pycharm. There's a few features we should know:
# 1. Pycharm has spellcheck for English words, that text editors like Replit don't
# 2. We can right-click and split screen to work with two projects in the same window
# 3. Built-in linter to take care of PEP-8 style guides
# 4. We can check the built-in coding history and revert back if needed.
# 5. The code structure, and all vars, functions, etc. can be seen and accessed.
# 6. We can refactor and rename all instances of a function name/var name easily.
# In pycharm, we can use double shift to search everywhere,
# Alt + Enter to make suggested changes, Ctrl+Shift+/ to comment, etc.
# We can use Alt+Shift+Select to write same thing on multiple consecutive lines

# In today's project, we will be making a Coffee Machine (Simulator?)
# We are given a menu and a list of resources from the course, and we have to
# work with it to satisfy the customer's orders. There's a code requirement
# so that it matches with the demo project, so here are the requirements:
# #TODO 1: Ask customer what to order : (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino)
# #TODO 2: Turn the coffee off if input is 'off'
# #TODO 3: Print a report of remaining ingredients and cash if input is "report"
# #TODO 4: If customer's request can't be met, return items insufficient.
# #TODO 5: Ask for coins after selecting drink and calculate based on values:
# #TODO 5: quarter = $0.5, dime = $0.1, nickel = $0.05 and cent = $0.01
# #TODO 6: Check transaction status depending on coins given and the cost
# #TODO 7: Make coffee, add cash to cash register and update resource values
