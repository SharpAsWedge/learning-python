<!--This is the final task for today,and it's a Color Vocabulary Project.
This page has different colors and their names in Spanish, it's like flashcard
The starting HTML code and hints are given here, and we don't have to change
anything here, but we need to create a style.css file to style this page acc
to the goals set by the course.
One thing I was surprised to see was that this project already contains css for
cropping images (just displaying default cropped part), which I hadn't tried
while doing the more detailed course in the past. I think I shouldn't have done
that course at all. I wouldn't, had I known about this course in the 4th semester-->
