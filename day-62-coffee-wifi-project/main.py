# In today's project we're building a Cofee and Wifi website, all the required stuff
# like html pages, Jinja templating, server setup has been done, we only need to make
# sure the ened result matches the one shown in the course
# The things that have to be done were in the requirements in the course, we will be
# working with that

# add: Location URL, open time, closing time, coffee rating, wifi rating, power outlet rating fields
